## Stage 1 — Scene, Camera & Stone Terrain

![Stage 1 — Isometric stone grid](screenshots/stage1-terrain.png)

### Goal
Stand up a Three.js scene with a proper isometric orthographic camera and a hand-laid stone floor.

---

### Isometric Camera

The defining choice of the whole project. An **orthographic** camera removes perspective foreshortening so tiles stay the same size across the entire grid. Positioning it at equal distances on all three world axes `(18, 18, 18)` produces the classic 45° isometric angle.

```js
const VIEW_SIZE = 10;
let aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;

const camera = new THREE.OrthographicCamera(
  -VIEW_SIZE * aspect,  VIEW_SIZE * aspect,  // left / right
   VIEW_SIZE,          -VIEW_SIZE,           // top / bottom
  0.1, 500                                   // near / far
);

camera.position.set(18, 18, 18);  // equal on all axes → true iso
camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0);
```

The frustum size is kept constant while `aspect` is recomputed on every window resize, so the scene stays centred on any screen.

---

### Stone Tile Terrain

Each tile is a `BoxGeometry` slightly smaller than `1 × 1` to leave a thin gap that reads as grout lines. Ten slightly-different grey tones are sampled at random so the floor looks hand-laid rather than tiled.

```js
const TILE_GAP    = 0.06;
const STONE_COLORS = [
  0x52525c, 0x4a4a58, 0x585862, 0x4e4e5a,
  0x545460, 0x5e5e68, 0x484852, 0x56565e,
  0x606068, 0x4c4c56,
];

const tileGeom = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1 - TILE_GAP, 0.22, 1 - TILE_GAP);

for (let x = -GRID_HALF; x <= GRID_HALF; x++) {
  for (let z = -GRID_HALF; z <= GRID_HALF; z++) {
    const color = STONE_COLORS[Math.floor(Math.random() * STONE_COLORS.length)];
    const tile  = new THREE.Mesh(tileGeom, new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color }));
    tile.position.set(x, -TILE_THICKNESS / 2, z);
    tile.receiveShadow = true;
    scene.add(tile);
  }
}
```

---

### Lighting Setup

Three lights are layered to give the scene depth without looking washed out.

| Light | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Ambient `0x8090b0` | `AmbientLight` | Cool blue fill, prevents pure-black shadows |
| Sun `0xffe8c0` | `DirectionalLight` + shadows | Warm key light with 2 k shadow map |
| Fill `0x4060a0` | `DirectionalLight` | Soft counter-light from the opposite corner |

```js
scene.add(new THREE.AmbientLight(0x8090b0, 1.0));

const sun = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffe8c0, 1.4);
sun.position.set(12, 20, 8);
sun.castShadow = true;
sun.shadow.mapSize.set(2048, 2048);
scene.add(sun);
```

## Stage 2 — Player Cube, Arrow Key Movement & Docker

![Stage 2 — Player on the grid](screenshots/stage2-player.png)

### Goal
Add a movable player cube and ship the whole thing as a Docker container served by nginx.

---

### Player Cube

The player is a `0.65 × 0.65 × 0.65` blue box. A small white "eye" child mesh is attached to its front face so the facing direction is always visible.

```js
const PLAYER_SIZE = 0.65;

const playerMesh = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.BoxGeometry(PLAYER_SIZE, PLAYER_SIZE, PLAYER_SIZE),
  new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: 0x4a8fe2 })
);
playerMesh.position.set(0, PLAYER_SIZE / 2, 0);  // sit on top of tiles
scene.add(playerMesh);

// White eye — attached to playerMesh so it inherits rotation
const eyeMesh = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.BoxGeometry(0.22, 0.16, 0.08),
  new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: 0xeef0ff })
);
eyeMesh.position.set(0, 0.06, -(PLAYER_SIZE / 2 + 0.02));  // front face
playerMesh.add(eyeMesh);
```

---

### Grid-Based Movement

Logical position (`grid.x / grid.z`) is kept separate from visual position (`playerMesh.position`). The logical position snaps to integers; the visual position exponentially lerps toward it each frame, giving smooth gliding without any animation library.

```js
const grid = { x: 0, z: 0 };

// Exponential lerp — frame-rate independent
const lerpK = 1 - Math.exp(-dt * 20);
playerMesh.position.x += (grid.x - playerMesh.position.x) * lerpK;
playerMesh.position.z += (grid.z - playerMesh.position.z) * lerpK;
```

A `moveCooldown` timer prevents the player from stepping every single frame when a key is held:

```js
let moveCooldown = 0;
const MOVE_DELAY = 0.13;  // seconds between steps

function processInput(dt) {
  moveCooldown -= dt;
  if (moveCooldown > 0) return;
  // ... read keys, move grid, reset cooldown
  moveCooldown = MOVE_DELAY;
}
```

The player rotates to face the direction of travel using `Math.atan2`:

```js
playerMesh.rotation.y = Math.atan2(dx, -dz);
```

---

### Drop Shadow

A transparent `PlaneGeometry` pinned just above the tile surface fakes a soft blob shadow. During later stages it scales down as the player jumps.

```js
const shadowBlob = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.PlaneGeometry(0.6, 0.6),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
    color: 0x000000, transparent: true,
    opacity: 0.25, depthWrite: false,
  })
);
shadowBlob.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2;
shadowBlob.position.y = 0.002;
scene.add(shadowBlob);
```

---

### Docker Setup

The game is three static files (`index.html`, `game.js`, `style.css`). `nginx:alpine` serves them with gzip and a one-day cache header. A `HEALTHCHECK` pings the server so Docker knows when the container is ready.

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:1.25-alpine

RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*

COPY index.html  /usr/share/nginx/html/
COPY game.js     /usr/share/nginx/html/
COPY style.css   /usr/share/nginx/html/
COPY nginx.conf  /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

EXPOSE 80

HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD wget -qO- http://localhost/ || exit 1

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  iso-game:
    build: .
    container_name: iso-game
    ports:
      - "8081:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

To run:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
# then open http://<your-local-ip>:8081
```

## Stage 3 — WASD, Camera Rotation, Compass & Eye Ray

![Stage 3 — Camera rotation and compass](screenshots/stage3-compass.png)

### Goal
Add WASD as a second input scheme, let the player orbit the camera with Z/C/X, show a compass in the corner, and project a red direction ray from the player's eye.

---

### Camera Orbit (Z / C / X)

The camera is repositioned to orbit the player at a fixed radius in the XZ plane. A `cameraRotStep` integer (0–3) drives 90° snaps; `targetCamAngle` is the desired angle; `currentCamAngle` is the smoothed value used for rendering. Shortest-arc interpolation prevents the camera spinning the long way around.

```js
const CAM_RADIUS        = 18 * Math.SQRT2;   // same distance as (18,18,18)
const DEFAULT_CAM_ANGLE = Math.PI / 4;        // 45° → camera at NE

let cameraRotStep   = 0;
let targetCamAngle  = DEFAULT_CAM_ANGLE;
let currentCamAngle = DEFAULT_CAM_ANGLE;

// On C keypress:
cameraRotStep  = (cameraRotStep + 1) % 4;
targetCamAngle = DEFAULT_CAM_ANGLE - cameraRotStep * (Math.PI / 2);

// Each frame — shortest-arc lerp:
let diff = targetCamAngle - currentCamAngle;
while (diff >  Math.PI) diff -= 2 * Math.PI;
while (diff < -Math.PI) diff += 2 * Math.PI;
currentCamAngle += diff * (1 - Math.exp(-dt * 8));

// Orbit position:
camera.position.x = playerMesh.position.x + CAM_RADIUS * Math.cos(currentCamAngle);
camera.position.y = CAM_HEIGHT;
camera.position.z = playerMesh.position.z + CAM_RADIUS * Math.sin(currentCamAngle);
camera.lookAt(playerMesh.position.x, 0, playerMesh.position.z);
```

---

### Compass HUD

A small `<canvas>` drawn each frame in the bottom-left corner. The ring of N/E/S/W labels rotates with the camera so you always know which world direction is where. A fixed white triangle at the top marks "screen up".

```js
function drawCompass() {
  // Rotate the label ring by the current camera step
  ctx2d.save();
  ctx2d.translate(CC, CC);
  ctx2d.rotate(cameraRotStep * (Math.PI / 2));   // 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°

  for (const [lbl, a] of [['N',0],['E',π/2],['S',π],['W',-π/2]]) {
    ctx2d.fillStyle = lbl === 'N' ? '#ff5555' : 'rgba(255,255,255,0.65)';
    ctx2d.fillText(lbl, Math.sin(a) * labelR, -Math.cos(a) * labelR);
  }
  ctx2d.restore();

  // Fixed "screen up" triangle — never rotates
  ctx2d.beginPath();
  ctx2d.moveTo(CC, 4);
  ctx2d.lineTo(CC - 4, 14);
  ctx2d.lineTo(CC + 4, 14);
  ctx2d.fill();
}
```

---

### Red Eye Ray

A `THREE.ArrowHelper` is attached directly to `playerMesh`. Because it is a child, it automatically inherits the player's world position and rotation — no manual update required.

```js
const rayArrow = new THREE.ArrowHelper(
  new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, -1),                            // local forward = −Z
  new THREE.Vector3(0, 0.06, -(PLAYER_SIZE / 2 + 0.02)), // starts at the eye
  12,       // extends 12 world units
  0xff2222,
  0.4,      // arrowhead length
  0.14      // arrowhead width
);
playerMesh.add(rayArrow);   // ← child of player, auto-follows rotation
```

## Stage 4 — Camera-Relative 8-Direction Movement, Jump & Lava Tiles

![Stage 4 — Lava area with pulsing glow](screenshots/stage4-lava.png)

### Goal
Make movement fully screen-relative (pressing ↑ moves toward the top of screen regardless of camera angle), allow diagonal tile movement, add a space-bar jump with physics, and introduce non-walkable lava tiles backed by a metadata system.

---

### Camera-Relative 8-Direction Movement

This is the most mathematically involved part of the project. The key insight comes from how Three.js `lookAt` constructs the camera's local axes.

For a camera at XZ angle α:

- **Screen right** (camera local +X) projected onto XZ = `( sin α, 0, −cos α )`
- **Screen up** (camera local +Y) projected onto XZ = `(−cos α, 0, −sin α )`

World movement is then:

```
world = ix · screen_right + (−iz) · screen_up
```

(`iz` is negated because `iz = +1` means "screen down", the opposite of screen-up.)

```js
const α    = targetCamAngle;   // always a multiple of π/4 → sin/cos = ±√2/2

const rawX =  ix * Math.sin(α) + iz * Math.cos(α);
const rawZ = -ix * Math.cos(α) + iz * Math.sin(α);

const dx = Math.round(rawX);   // snaps to −1, 0, or +1
const dz = Math.round(rawZ);
```

Because `α` is always a multiple of 45°, `sin(α)` and `cos(α)` are always `±√2/2 ≈ 0.707`, and `Math.round(0.707) = 1`. This means:

| Keys held | Screen direction | World movement (step 0) |
|---|---|---|
| W only | Up-left | `(−1, −1)` — NW diagonal |
| D only | Up-right | `(+1, −1)` — NE diagonal |
| S only | Down-right | `(+1, +1)` — SE diagonal |
| A only | Down-left | `(−1, +1)` — SW diagonal |
| W + D | Up | `(0, −1)` — North |
| W + A | Left | `(−1, 0)` — West |
| S + D | Right | `(+1, 0)` — East |
| S + A | Down | `(0, +1)` — South |

Pressing two keys combines the two diagonal vectors into a pure cardinal direction — the player gets all 8 directions from just 4 keys, and it all stays correct through every camera rotation.

---

### Jump Physics

A classic discrete-time Euler integration: each frame, gravity pulls `jumpVelocity` down; the player Y position is updated by the current velocity; when Y returns to zero the player is grounded.

```js
const JUMP_SPEED = 7.5;
const GRAVITY    = 22;

// On Space keydown (only when grounded):
if (e.code === 'Space' && isGrounded) {
  jumpVelocity = JUMP_SPEED;
  isGrounded   = false;
}

// Each frame:
if (!isGrounded) {
  jumpVelocity -= GRAVITY * dt;
  playerJumpY  += jumpVelocity * dt;
  if (playerJumpY <= 0) {
    playerJumpY  = 0;
    jumpVelocity = 0;
    isGrounded   = true;
  }
}

// Shadow shrinks / fades proportionally to height
const shadowS = Math.max(0.15, 1 - playerJumpY * 0.18);
shadowBlob.scale.set(shadowS, 1, shadowS);
shadowBlob.material.opacity = 0.25 * shadowS;
```

---

### Tile Metadata & Lava Area

Every tile is stored in `tileMap[x][z]` with a typed metadata object:

```js
// tileMap[x][z] = {
//   walkable : boolean   — false blocks movement onto this tile
//   type     : string    — 'stone' | 'lava'
//   mesh     : THREE.Mesh
// }

tileMap[x][z] = {
  walkable : !isLava,
  type     : isLava ? 'lava' : 'stone',
  mesh     : tile,
};
```

The `isWalkable()` helper checks both bounds and the metadata flag:

```js
function isWalkable(x, z) {
  if (Math.abs(x) > GRID_HALF || Math.abs(z) > GRID_HALF) return false;
  return tileMap[x]?.[z]?.walkable !== false;
}
```

Movement is gated through this check — lava tiles simply can't be entered:

```js
if (isWalkable(nx, nz)) {
  grid.x = nx;
  grid.z = nz;
} else {
  // HUD shows "tile: lava  walkable: false  ← blocked"
}
```

The lava blob is hand-placed as a `Set` of `"x,z"` keys, giving explicit authoring control over the shape:

```js
const LAVA_COORDS = new Set([
              '5,3', '6,3',
    '4,4',   '5,4', '6,4', '7,4',
'3,5','4,5', '5,5', '6,5', '7,5',
    '4,6',   '5,6', '6,6', '7,6',
              '5,7', '6,7', '7,7',
]);
```

Lava materials use `emissive` to self-illuminate even when shadowed, and a pulsing `PointLight` floats above the area:

```js
mat.emissive.setHex(0x441100);
mat.emissiveIntensity = 0.6;

// In animate():
lavaLight.intensity = 1.8 + Math.sin(t * 2.8) * 0.6;
```
